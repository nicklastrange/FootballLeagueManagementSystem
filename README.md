## Start a competition!

After all necessary configuration you can start a competition! Minimal requirement is just 2 teams, simply because you will not be able to play a league without teams or only with one team! When you will start a competition schedule with games between participants will be generated automatically!

## View and manage results!

When competition is ongoing you can now fill the results of every match in the schedule and see the table with latest results!

Only when all matches in the scheduled competition will be resolved, you can finish the season. Finished competitions are visible in the Archive tab, where you can see the details about the competition and even clone it to use it as a basis for another league!

Anyway .NET is piece of crap, please don't code in this!
